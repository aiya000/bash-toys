# A shorthand to `cat $(which cmd)`.
# (Also, not plain text executables are skipped.)
#
# This uses bat (batcat) instead of cat if available automatically.
# - bat: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
#
# Example:
# ```shell-session
# $ cat-which dust  # If a plain text script specified
# (The contents of dust will be displayed)
#
# $ cat-which zsh  # If a binary specified
# Not a plain text: /bin/zsh
# ```

function show_help () {
  cat << 'EOF'
cat-which - Display contents of executable files in PATH

Usage:
  cat-which COMMAND
  cat-which --help

Arguments:
  COMMAND            Name of the command to display

Options:
  --help            Show this help message

Notes:
  - Uses bat/batcat if available, falls back to cat
  - Binary files will be skipped with an error message
