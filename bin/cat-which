# A shorthand to `cat $(which cmd)`.
# (Also, not plain text executables are skipped.)
#
# This uses bat (batcat) instead of cat if available automatically.
# - bat: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
#
# Example:
# ```shell-session
# $ cat-which dust  # If a plain text script specified
# (The contents of dust will be displayed)
#
# $ cat-which zsh  # If a binary specified
# Not a plain text: /bin/zsh
# ```

dir=$(dirname "$0")

# shellcheck disable=SC1091
source "$dir/../default-options.sh"

if command -v batcat > /dev/null 2>&1 || command -v bat > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
  cat="batcat $BASH_TOYS_BATCAT_OPTIONS"
else
  cat='cat'
fi

cmd_path=$(which "$1")

if [[ $(file "$cmd_path") =~ text ]] ; then
  $cat "$cmd_path"
else
  echo "Not a plain text: $cmd_path" > /dev/stderr
  exit 1
