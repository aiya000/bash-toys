# A path abbreviation command, like `pathshorten()` in Vim script
# - Print paths relative to home directory.
# - Shorten parent directories to 4 characters or less.
# - But do not abbreviate the last directory name (or file name)
#
# ```shell-session
# $ pathshorten ~/Repository/luarrow.lua/src/luarrow
# ~/Repo/luar/src/luarrow
#
# $ pathshorten ~/Repository/luarrow.lua/src/luarrow/arrow.lua
# ~/Repo/luar/src/luar/arrow.lua
# ```
