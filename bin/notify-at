# Sends notification at specified time with flexible date formats
#
# This is a wrapper that delegates to platform-specific implementations:
# - macOS: notify-at-launchd (uses launchd for reliable GUI notifications)
# - Linux: notify-at-at (uses at command)
#
# Requirements:
# - ./notify (for local notifications)
# - ./notify-ntfy (for mobile notifications)
# - ./notify-at-at (if using Linux or WSL (not macOS))
# - ./notify-at-launchd (if using macOS)
#
# Supported time formats:
# - HH:MM                - Time today (if past, then tomorrow)
# - MM-DD HH:MM          - Month-day-time (must be future)
# - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM     - Year-month-day-time (must be future)
#
# ```shell-session
# $ notify-at 12:00 "Meeting" "Team meeting"                    # Today at 12:00
# $ notify-at "01-15 09:00" "Reminder" "New year meeting"       # January 15 at 09:00
# $ notify-at "2027-01-15 09:00" "Reminder" "Future meeting"    # Future date
# $ notify-at 12:00 "Meeting" "Team meeting" --mobile           # Mobile only
# $ notify-at 12:00 "Meeting" "Team meeting" --mobile --local   # Both mobile and local
# ```
